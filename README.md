bijectiv
========

*A bijection is a function between the elements of two sets, where every element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and every element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set.* -- [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection)

... and **bijectiv is an addictive object-to-object mapping library for .NET.**

This project is currently under active development.
