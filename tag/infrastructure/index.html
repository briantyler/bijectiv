                    <p>For dyed in the wool visual studio fanboys like myself the blog theme will be clear - it is an homage to the king of IDEs itself (the 2012 edition where form was emphasised so heavily over function in release 1 that it was no longer possible to develop WPF applications visually due to the black artboard: in fact later on in the development cycle when applications had grown into hundred view monsters that bootstrapped from autofac through caliburn the designer just stopped working anyway, at which point everyone switched it off and coded blind like zatoichi - feeling their way through nested markup extensions, in edaphic genuflection looking for some rhyme or reason).

                    <p>Step 1 has been getting the blog set up (maybe that it more like step 7). By day I build .NET enterprise stuff, it is quite funky for .NET enterprise stuff, but not cool. It seems like the internet is for cool kids and cool kids like static sites: that makes sense to me, the thing that has been putting me off blogging is the heavyweight bloat and lack of control you get with workpress (a typeo but I like it, sic.) or its peers. Cool kids also it seems like github - being deeply ingrained in the Microsoft stack I'm more of a CodePlex kind of guy, but hey back when I was cool (read didn't have children) I used git and linux (gentoo from back in the day that there was a 23 page install guide and that took 4 days to complete and you installed everything from source and maybe it might boot into KDE at the end - emerge world of course never worked), so I'm going to publish this with jekyll from a mint VM. I know, I know, jekyll is way not cool and there is somthing much more uber out there that will rock my world, but the quick start guide was almost that (although it was nice to see that the person who packaged it in mint forgot the ruby dev dependencies - that gave me the good old time linux feel).

                    <p>This site documents how the <a href="https://github.com/TheMouthOfACow/bijectiv" />bijectiv</a> object-to-object .NET mapping library got/is getting built.<p>
                    <p>Bijectiv is (being) written by Brian Tyler in his (very limited, see small child to the right) spare time; by day I'm a technical architect developer at Aon's global headquarters in London, the rest of the time I do <a href="http://kozuetyler.wordpress.com/">family stuff</a>.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the library is to provide an industrial strength, open source mapper for .NET and the reason for the blog is to describe why it is built the way it is and to act as a resource for other developers who are interested in how a library could be designed and coded.</p>
                    <p>The blog is written using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on Mint Linux (apparently that's the way the cool kids do it these days). The library is written in Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate on Windows 8.1 and runs portably in the .NET 4.0 runtime.</p>
