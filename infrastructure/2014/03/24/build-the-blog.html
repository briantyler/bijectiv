    <div class="post-body"><div class="vertical-line right"></div><p>Step 1 has been getting the blog set up (maybe that it more like step 7). By day I build .NET enterprise stuff, it is quite funky for .NET enterprise stuff, but not cool. It seems like the internet is for cool kids and cool kids like static sites: that makes sense to me, the thing that has been putting me off blogging is the heavyweight bloat and lack of control you get with workpress (a typeo but I like it, sic.) or its peers. Cool kids also it seems like github - being deeply ingrained in the Microsoft stack I&#39;m more of a CodePlex kind of guy, but hey back when I was cool (read didn&#39;t have children) I used git and linux (gentoo from back in the day that there was a 23 page install guide and that took 4 days to complete and you installed everything from source and maybe it might boot into KDE at the end - emerge world of course never worked), so I&#39;m going to publish this with jekyll from a mint VM. I know, I know, jekyll is way not cool and there is somthing much more uber out there that will rock my world, but the quick start guide was almost that (although it was nice to see that the person who packaged it in mint forgot the ruby dev dependencies - that gave me the good old time linux feel).</p>
